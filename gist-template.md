# Regex Tutorial for Matching a Hex Value
---

Introductory paragraph (replace this with your text)

Regex, also known as regular expressions, define a **search pattern** by utilizing a series of characters. 
When using Regex, you look at each character and translate what they mean. 
For example : "Cat" is a captical "C" followed by a lowercase "a" and lowercase "t". 
- in this case, each of these characters are literal characters 

"Meta" vs. "Literal" characters

Meta character refers to a general pattern rather than a literal character. Using the above example of "Cat", want a Uppercase character followed by two lowercase characters. 
## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

In this tutorial, we will use an example to match a hexcode. A hex code is a format to identify colors with a six custom characters. 

`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

Here is a quick summary of what these characters represent : 
- "/" 
- "^" start of a string
- "#" Literal character, the hex code will start with this
- "(" ")" start and end of a group 
- "[" "]" start and end of a group ?
- "a-f" any letter a-f
- "0-9" any number 0-9
- "{6}" "{3}" length of whatever number is inside the curly brackets
- "|" or
- "$" end of a string

## Regex Components
---
### Anchors
---
Anchors are used to signify the the start and end to a string. Both "^" and "$" are anchors. 

In our example : `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`
- The "^" anchor is used to start the string
- The "$" anchor is used to end the string

### Quantifiers
---
Quantifiers set the length of sections of the string. 

In our example : `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`
- The "?" matches the pattern zero or one time
- The "{6}" and "{3}" signify that the length of that part of the string will be what is inside the curly brackets

### OR Operator
---

In our example : `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`
- "|" or



### Character Classes
---
- .
- \d
- \w
- \s 


### Flags
---
- g
- i
- m


### Grouping and Capturing
---

In our example : `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`
- "(" ")" start and end of a group 



### Bracket Expressions
---

In our example :  `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`
- "[ ]" everything in this is what we want to include in our regex
- "a-f" any letter a-f
- "0-9" any number 0-9


### Summary
---

Here is a quick summary of what these characters represent : 
`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

- "/" 
- "^" start of a string
- "#" Literal character, the hex code will start with this
- "?" matches the pattern zero or one time
- "( )" start and end of a group 
- "[ ]" start and end of a bracket expression
- "a-f" any letter a-f
- "0-9" any number 0-9
- "{ }" length of whatever number is inside the curly brackets
- "|" or operator
- "$" end of a string
